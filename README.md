README for Normal Linux Virtual Machine Setup
Introduction
This README file provides instructions on setting up a normal Linux Virtual Machine (VM) along with implicit dependencies. This guide assumes you are familiar with basic Linux commands and virtualization concepts.

Prerequisites
A hypervisor installed on your host machine (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V).
An ISO file of the Linux distribution you want to install (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
Steps to Set Up a Linux VM
1. Download and Install a Hypervisor
VirtualBox

Download from: VirtualBox Download
Install the downloaded package.
VMware

Download from: VMware Download
Install the downloaded package.
Hyper-V (Windows only)

Enable Hyper-V from Windows Features.
2. Create a New Virtual Machine
Open your hypervisor (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware).
Create a new VM:
Name your VM.
Select the type and version of the Linux distribution.
Allocate memory (RAM) for the VM.
Create a virtual hard disk and allocate storage space.
3. Configure the Virtual Machine
Attach the Linux ISO file:

Go to the VM settings.
Navigate to the storage section.
Attach the downloaded Linux ISO file as a virtual CD/DVD.
Adjust Network Settings:

Choose the appropriate network adapter settings (NAT, Bridged Adapter, etc.).
4. Install Linux on the VM
Start the VM:

Boot from the attached ISO file.
Follow the on-screen instructions to install the Linux distribution.
Complete the installation:

Set up the root user and create a new user account.
Configure the system settings as needed.
5. Post-Installation Setup
Update the System:

Open a terminal and run:
sh
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
(For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu)
sh
Copy code
sudo yum update
(For Red Hat-based systems like CentOS)
Install Essential Tools and Dependencies:

Some common tools and dependencies you might need:
sh
Copy code
sudo apt install build-essential git curl wget
sh
Copy code
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" && sudo yum install git curl wget
Configure Additional Software:

Install any other software or dependencies required for your specific use case.
Implicit Dependencies
Implicit dependencies refer to system libraries and packages that are typically pre-installed with the Linux distribution or installed automatically when required by other software. Some common implicit dependencies include:

GCC: The GNU Compiler Collection, necessary for compiling software from source.
Make: A build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries.
Libc: The GNU C Library, providing the core libraries for the C programming language.
Ensure these dependencies are installed by running:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt install gcc make libc6-dev
sh
Copy code
sudo yum install gcc make glibc-devel
Conclusion
You have now set up a normal Linux Virtual Machine with implicit dependencies. Customize and configure your VM further based on your specific requirements. For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the official documentation of the Linux distribution and the hypervisor you are using.

Happy virtualizing!
